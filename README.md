### Create a program that
Is to be used by a teacher to enter a student's name (first and last), their middle initial, their mark (as a  percent) for English, Math, Science, and History, and what grade the student was in. Make sure to output this with a title and underline, the students full name, marks, average, and what grade they're in. Make sure you include proper input instructions, and a well formatted output screen (use tabs).
